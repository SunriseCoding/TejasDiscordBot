Hey! I am Tejas Gupta and as of my knowledge, on 3rd October 2025, I am 14 years of age. I have a passion for coding and whenever I see something, I think if I could make this? And the answer is probably no... But not today (today not your actual todey, today refers to 3rd October, 2025)!

I had set my eyes upon Discord and thought, hmm... can I make it, so I did some "research" and mid-"research"-ing I got distracted and fell into the incredible world of DISCORD BOTS!!!!

And I first followed the official guide for it, then took another guide from a different website which was way easier, phew! So, I managed to make this.

So, here, I introduce you Tejas' Discord Bot! It has a whoppin' 2 commands! Which can run absolutely nothing... yea it is bad, but don't worry that much. Keep checking this Repository and you can find updates to this.

I almost forgot, here's the bot link to download the bot which will run on Discord, my og bot: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1423298624657555536

Thanks for using this btw!

P.S, make sure to put a .env file with PUBLIC_KEY and BOT_TOKEN.
